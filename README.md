Web Flat UI for Transmission

**NB: This is modified version of [https://github.com/Kalizo/Transmission-WFUI](https://github.com/Kalizo/Transmission-WFUI)**

## Description

Transmission-WFUI is a simplified interface to Transmission. I cleaned many features and got flat design.

## Installation

### OS X

Copy the contents to `~/Applications/Transmission/Contents/Resources/Web`

### Linux

(This UI is based on Transmission 2.84 running on Debian 8)

First, save the original UI with :

```sh
$ mv /usr/share/transmission/web/ /usr/share/transmission/web.old/
```

Then, download the new UI :

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Kalizo/Transmission-WFUI.git /usr/share/transmission/web/
```

Hum... Wait... That's all !
